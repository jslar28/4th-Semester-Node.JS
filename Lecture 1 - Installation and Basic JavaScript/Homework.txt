Deadline: We will use it next week. 

If you don't have it, install a unix-like shell environment. 
Success criteria: Be able to type ssh without getting an error (You should get some options). 
Recommendation for windows user: Cygwin. 
ConEmu is highly modifiable solution that allows for multi-tabs of cygwin and other terminals. Not necessary at all but fun to play around with.

Later in the class we need to log into mysql and create a database. I highly recommend that you can log in through the terminal to follow the lesson better. Find the solution that works best for you. 
Sucess criteria: Log into mysql and create a database called test. Delete the database again.
Deadline: You have 7 weeks to figure this out. 

Help your classmates who couldn't make it today with downloading the right tools, have them mail me to get on Ryver. From now on it will be your responsibility to keep up to date if you don't come to class.
