// Exercises 2 - Arrays, for loops
//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 1 - Array Positioning

var letters = ["a","b","c"];
// show b in the console 

//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 2 - Array Positioning

var friends = [];

// What a lonely array. Add at least 3 friend objects to it.  

//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 3 - Get the index of first occurance of that value. 

var significantMathNumbers = [0, 2.718, 3.14159, 1729]

// You want to programmatically find where the number 1729 is in the array.
// programmatically means that no finger counting allowed. There is a method for this (finding index based of value). 


//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 4 - Inserting elements

var diet = ["tomato", "cucumber", "rocolla", "kale"]

// You are a programmer. In one line (one statement) insert hamburger, soda and pizza between the elements rocolla and kale

//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 5 - Remove element

// You don't like kale at all. Remove the LAST element of the array.
// Don't remove by index. You know in advance that it's the last in the array because you are too full already. 

//--------------------------------------




//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 6 - Copy array

// You really like your daily diet from last exercise. Copy it to a new array called dinnerTray so you can give it to a friend.  

//--------------------------------------

 array.slice(start, end)  // start and end are optional

//--------------------------------------
// Exercise 7 - For loop

var letters = ["a","b","c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"];

// log every second char in the array starting from b

//--------------------------------------
//Exercise 8 - For loop and if statement

var numbers  = [5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 12, 0, -20, 6];

var discardedNumbers = [];

// log the element if the number is above 6 or below 0
// else push them to the array discardedNumbers
